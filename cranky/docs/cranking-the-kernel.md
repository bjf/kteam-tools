#                             Turning the Crank

Turning the crank refers to the process by which the Canonical Kernel Team
creates new kernels and updates all our existing kernels every three weeks as
part of the Ubuntu Stable Release Update (SRU) process.  To compliment the SRU
process the kernel engineering team has created a rich toolset for kernel
cranking, which we maintain in the kteam-tools repo, which you will need to
clone to your local machine as part of setting up your development
environment.

While the information in this document sufficiently covers all the necessary
steps a new kernel engineer needs to perform in order to crank a kernel, it is
expected that a mentor is assigned to any new/unfamiliar engineer to answer
questions and explain details for what is being done in each step for which
kernel and why.  Without understanding what is actually being done by these
tools, it is difficult to properly debug and solve issues on when something
inevitably breaks in the process.

This document is the work of Stefan Bader and Andrea Righi, with collaboration
by Kleber Souza and content/editing by Terry Rudd. Any of us can be contacted
regarding issues or additional suggested content contribution but all Kernel
engineers should feel free to make change/update this document in kteam-tools.

## Setup

### Initialize chroot environment - `cranky chroot`
<!--cheatsheet-->
```
cranky chroot create-base RELEASE:linux
cranky chroot create-session configs RELEASE:linux
```
<!--/cheatsheet-->

Make sure you have a proper chroot environment for the release and the kernel
that you are going to build.

Example:
```
cranky chroot run xenial:linux -- cat /etc/debian_chroot
```

If you get something like `xenial-amd64` the chroot environment is correctly
initialized.

Otherwise, if you get an error, you need to initialize the chroot environment
to properly build the kernel. In this case use `cranky chroot` to create the
chroot environment for the kernel to build (as documented in
"crank-turning-setup.md").

Example:
```
cranky chroot create-base xenial:linux
cranky chroot create-session configs xenial:linux
```

## Build

### Clone and checkout the kernel repository - `cranky checkout`
<!--cheatsheet-->
```
cranky checkout RELEASE:KERNEL
```
<!--/cheatsheet-->

Use `cranky checkout` to get the kernel that you want to build.

Example:
```
cd canonical/kernel/ubuntu
cranky checkout xenial:linux-oracle
```

**Note**: private kernels repositories should be cloned via `git+ssh`
using your launchpad ID. In other to do so, it's necessary to include
the following configuration to your `~/.gitconfig` file:

```
[url "git+ssh://<your-launchpad-id>@git.launchpad.net/<project>"]
	insteadof = lp:~<project>
	insteadof = git://git.launchpad.net/<project>
```

For example, for linux-fips:

```
[url "git+ssh://<your-launchpad-id>@git.launchpad.net/~fips-cc-stig"]`
	insteadof = lp:~fips-cc-stig`
	insteadof = git://git.launchpad.net/~fips-cc-stig`
```

**Note**: private kernels repositories should be cloned via `git+ssh`
using your launchpad ID. In other to do so, it's necessary to include
the following configuration to your `~/.gitconfig` file:

```
[url "git+ssh://<your-launchpad-id>@git.launchpad.net/<project>"]
	insteadof = lp:~<project>
	insteadof = git://git.launchpad.net/<project>
```

For example, for linux-fips:

```
[url "git+ssh://<your-launchpad-id>@git.launchpad.net/~fips-cc-stig"]`
	insteadof = lp:~fips-cc-stig`
	insteadof = git://git.launchpad.net/~fips-cc-stig`
```

### dkms package update stage - `update-version-dkms`
<!--cheatsheet-->
```
./update-version-dkms POCKET
```
<!--/cheatsheet-->

In bionic and newer, this updates the package versions in `debian/dkms-versions`
to match those currently present in the specified pocket. For SRU kernels
`POCKET` should be `updates`.  For development kernels it will typically be
`proposed`.

**Note**: `update-version-dkms` should only need to be run for primary and hwe
kernels.  Other derivatives generally should not be deviating from the versions
in the primary kernel.

Example:
```
./update-version-dkms updates
```

### Tool sync stage - `cranky fix`
<!--cheatsheet-->
```
cranky fix
```
<!--/cheatsheet-->

This updates the local (in-tree) helper scripts which cranky uses to the latest
version and also can update/create the "debian./etc/update.conf" file and
commits those changes. In case of a rebase tree, the changes to the helpers may
vanish on rebase if those were already done there.
```
cd xenial/linux-oracle
cranky fix
```

**Note** The `cranky fix` step has a chicken/egg problem when unbreaking a
derivative chain. For example a senior crank turner got the wrong master
directory when doing the new trusty/azure. Care must be taken to verify.

### Rebase stage - `cranky rebase`
<!--cheatsheet-->
```
cranky rebase
```
<!--/cheatsheet-->

At this stage, master kernels do not require anything to be done. So, running
`cranky rebase` on them should be a no-op, resulting in no change.

For both derivatives and backports, `cranky rebase` is the first stage. In both
cases one has to fetch the tip of the branch from which the current kernel is
derived/backported from. For derivatives, this is a local branch name which is
specified by "-l BRANCH". For backports this is a remote repository (which
can be an URL or a path to a local git repository) and a remote branch name
"(-r REPO -b BRANCH)".

If no options are used, the default remote location defined in "update.conf" is
used. This should be good enough for most cases as long as one does not mind
the network traffic. But working on embargoed CVEs will require using the
options because that process requires private repositories.

Should there be any conflicts during the rebase, normal git conflict resolution
steps "git rebase ---skip, git rebase --continue, ..." have to be taken.

Example:
```
cranky rebase
```

Another example:
```
cranky rebase -r LOCAL_PATH_TO_KERNEL_GIT_REPO [-b master-next]
```

**Note** some times `cranky rebase` can fail due to conflicts. If conflicts are
affecting the debian helper scripts (debian/scripts) you can safely skip the
commit and continue with the rebase:
```
git rebase --skip
```

Conflicts that cannot be resolve this way, must be resolved manually.

**Note** Continue until the rebase completes without any conflicts and re-run
`cranky fix` at the end to make sure the helper scripts are correct.
```
$ cranky fix
```

At this point you should double check that the version number at the top of
"debian.master/changelog" matches the version that you see on the dashboard:
```
https://kernel.ubuntu.com/sru/dashboards/web/kernel-stable-board.html
```

Look under "linux", inside the section of the release in the dashboard you are
currently cranking such as "xenial".

### Starting commit - `cranky open`
<!--cheatsheet-->
```
cranky open
```
<!--/cheatsheet-->

When a new release is in the plans, a starting commit should be created. That
historically has been done with "maint-startnewrelease". Now, it's done by
running `cranky open`. This step should be done after rebasing, because it's
needed on backports as well, where the "update-from-master" script is called,
but the changelog is opened just for inclusions.  The insertion of changelog
entries is done by the cranky close stage.
```
$ cranky open
```

**Note** `cranky start` is still available but `cranky open` usage is
preferable. Use `cranky start --force` if you find any blocking issues
with `cranky open`.

**Note** regarding private kernels: One of the steps performed by
`cranky open` is to download and update the ABI files based on the
last release and those files are obtained from a list of
repositories. For regular kernels that list is kept in-tree in the
file `debian.<variant>/etc/getabis`. For private kernels, this list is
retrieved from the file `~/.getabis.<series>-<variant>` (for instance:
`~/.getabis.bionic-fips`). That file should be created manually
containing on each line an URL (that can be obtained from the
`kteam-tools/info/kernel-series.yaml` file), but including your
subscription credentials to the PPA.

An example of an URL is:

```
https://USER:PASS@private-ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-advantage/fips-kernel-source/ubuntu
```

The username and password can be obtained from
<https://launchpad.net/~/+archivesubscriptions>.

### Link to tracker - `cranky link-tb`
<!--cheatsheet-->
```
cranky link-tb
```
<!--/cheatsheet-->

Link current build to tracker bug in Launchpad:
```
$ cranky link-tb
```

**Note** this command is making public changes, it's not only affecting your
local repository. Make sure to skip this test if you're doing local tests.

### Closing commit - `cranky close`
<!--cheatsheet-->
```
cranky close
```
<!--/cheatsheet-->

The last commit before a release is prepared by using `cranky close`. All of
the following steps are done automatically by `cranky close` so there is no
need to run any of them manually but they are explained here so that the
crank-turner knows what's going on for trouble-shooting purposes.
```
$ cranky close
```

This step:
1) Verifies there are no config changes left, by running "debian/rules
updateconfig" and checking no changes have been done;

**Note** It's possible that config changes were made in this release that trigger
further config changes (e.g. dependency config options). In that case, those
dependency changes will be generated when running 'updateconfigs', and cranky-
close will print a message about those config changes and then exit early without
committing anything to the tree.

Those generated config changes need to be manually committed by the user first
before cranky-close can resume. The commit message for those changes should
reference the bug number that caused the original config change.

In some cases, 'updateconfigs' will trigger a user prompt asking the user to
specify a value for the dependency config options. The value that should be
specified depends on the kernel being cranked and the config option in question.
Again, those config changes need to be manually committed before cranky-close can
continue.

After committing all dependency config changes, cranky-close needs to be re-run and
it should add the closing commit normally at that point.

2) Runs "insert-ubuntu-changes" to insert into the changelog the changes that
come from a master kernel. When `cranky close` is run on a master kernel, it
won't perform this step.

3) Runs "debian/rules insertchanges", inserting into the changelog the changes
that it finds from git.

4) Updates the release series, author and date on the changelog, thus closing
the changelog.

5) Commits with the correct messages.

**Note**: Private kernels might have commits that reference private
bugs or SalesForce cases (please check the private kernel git log to
find out what is usually used for each case) and because of that
`debian/rules insertchanges` might not be able to obtain the launchpad
bug title.

To workaround that, it's possible to update the commit message adding
the the bug title between parenthesis just after the Buglink URL, for
example:

- `BugLink: http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/9999999 (Private bug title... (LP: #9999999))`.
- `BugLink: https://canonical.my.salesforce.com/XXXXXXX (SF case title (SF: #99999999))`.

For patchsets, please make sure the exact same text between
parenthesis is used for all the patches in the series, otherwise
they will **not** be grouped in the changelog.

## Test

### Testing builds - `cranky test-build`
<!--cheatsheet-->
```
cranky-test-build [-a ARCH[,ARCH,...]|-a all] [-f] HOST
```
<!--/cheatsheet-->

Uses the "git-build-kernel" method to test-build the tip of the kernel branch
currently checked out.

Example:
```
cranky test-build -f -a all kathleen
```

Make sure to specify "-a all" for official builds, we want to make sure the
kernel builds in all architectures, otherwise `cranky test-build` would build
the kernel only for the host's architecture.

If the test build fails and you need to apply additional fixes, make sure to
re-run `cranky close` once all additional fixes have been applied successfully.

**No additional commits should be added without re-running cranky close.**

**Note** crank-turners need to add the following host entry to /etc/hosts
before running the example command: `cranky test-build -f -a all kathleen`
10.246.72.52 kathleen

**Note 2** kathleen in the example above represents both a git remote name,
which by default matches the name of the remote build host.

### Tagging - `cranky tag`
<!--cheatsheet-->
```
cranky tag
```
<!--/cheatsheet-->

Run the following command to apply the correct tag to the kernel:
```
cranky tag
```

### Prepare meta/signed repositories - `cranky prepare-meta`
<!--cheatsheet-->
```
cd linux-meta && ./update-version ../linux
cd linux-signed && ./update-version ../linux
```
<!--/cheatsheet-->

Currently this step must be done manually, calling the "./update-version"
scripts from "linux-meta" and "linux-signed" (the additional repositories
cloned via `cranky checkout`).

Example:
```
cd ../linux-meta-oracle
./update-version ../linux-oracle

cd ../linux-signed-oracle
./update-version ../linux-oracle
```

Output (for both commands) should look like this:
...
git commit -s -m 'UBUNTU: Ubuntu-oracle-4.15.0.1031.31' debian/changelog
git tag -s -m 'Ubuntu-oracle-4.15.0.1031.31' 'Ubuntu-oracle-4.15.0.1031.31'

**Note** update-version doesn't run the "git commit" and "git tag" commands
so you must run them next.  These are last two lines printed to stdout above
and are the commands you need to copy and run them manually.
```
$ git commit -s -m 'UBUNTU: Ubuntu-oracle-4.15.0.1031.31' debian/changelog
$ git tag -s -m 'Ubuntu-oracle-4.15.0.1031.31' 'Ubuntu-oracle-4.15.0.1031.31'
```

It is mandatory to run "udpate-version' from the "linux-meta" and
"linux-signed" directory, not from the kernel source directory.

**Note** In certain releases "linux-signed" is missing, for example
"linux-kvm". To show the list of packages that are part of a certain kernel
set, you can use the command `cranky rmadison`, example:
```
cranky rmadison xenial:linux-oracle
```

### Verify preparation
<!--cheatsheet-->
```
$ cd linux-oracle && ~/canonical/kteam-tools/maintscripts/verify-release-ready
$ cd linux-meta-oracle && ~/canonical/kteam-tools/maintscripts/verify-release-ready
$ cd linux-signed-oracle && ~/canonical/kteam-tools/maintscripts/verify-release-ready
```
<!--/cheatsheet-->

Perform one last sanity check on the git trees with `verify-release-ready` to catch
many of the mistakes that will require changes before this kernel passes review.

### Build sources - `cranky build-sources`
<!--cheatsheet-->
```
cranky build-sources
```
<!--/cheatsheet-->

Before running `cranky build-sources`, you need to download the previous
source packages to the parent directory. Note that you need to download all
source packages listed by `cranky rmadison` for the kernel set you're working
on.

Example:

```
$ cd ..
$ cranky-pull-source linux-oracle xenial
$ cranky-pull-source linux-meta-oracle xenial
$ cranky-pull-source linux-signed-oracle xenial
$ cd -
```

Doing it this way, `cranky build-sources` will produce the diff.gz instead of
whole tarballs.

Now run `cranky build-sources` from the main kernel source directory to build the
source packages.

Example:

```
cd linux-oracle
cranky build-sources
```

**Note:** If you are performing a respin and the package version in `-proposed` is greater
than the package version in `-updates`, then the package version in `-updates` must be
supplied to `cranky build-sources` so the source packages are built against the correct
package versions to preserve the delta between the one in `-updates` and the current spin.
One can use `cranky rmadison` to see what versions are in `-updates` and `-proposed`.

Example:

```
$ cranky rmadison xenial:linux-oracle
$ # output of cranky rmadison omitted for brevity
$ cd linux-oracle
$ cranky build-sources --build-opts "main:-v4.15.0-1021.23~16.04.1" --build-opts "meta:-v4.15.0.1021.15" --build-opts "signed:-v4.15.0-1021.23~16.04.1"
```

## Review

### Reviewing - `cranky review`
<!--cheatsheet-->
```
cranky review *.changes
```
<!--/cheatsheet-->

Generates debdiff files for review between newly generated .dsc files and
those currently in the archive. Takes source.changes filenames as
argument(s) and produces .debdiff files for review.

Example (run this on the same directory where the .changes and .dsc files have
been generated by the previous step):
```
cranky review *.changes
```

### Sign packages - `debsign`

Sign the source packages:
```
debsign *_source.changes
```

**Note** While this step is not really needed (unless you already have upload
rights) it is a good practice to keep doing it and make it a common routine for
times when you will have upload rights.

### Uploading packages - `cranky upload`

**Note** DO NOT publish private kernels such as ESM, linux-ibm-gt and
linux-fips, see section "Special kernels" below.

Push git repositories to your Launchpad for a review (only push master or
master-next and the last tag applied):
```
cd linux-oracle
git remote add for-review lps:~YOUR_LAUNCHPAD_USERNAME>/+git/xenial-linux-oracle
git push for-review cranky/master-next
git push for-review TAG
cd ..

cd linux-meta-oracle
git remote add for-review lps:~YOUR_LAUNCHPAD_USERNAME/+git/xenial-linux-meta-oracle
git push for-review cranky/master
git push for-review TAG
cd ..

cd linux-signed-oracle
git remote add for-review lps:~YOUR_LAUNCHPAD_USERNAME/+git/xenial-linux-signed-oracle
git push for-review cranky/master
git push for-review TAG
cd ..
```

TAG represents the last tag applied on each repository. The last tag can be
determined running the following command:
```
git tag --sort=creatordate | tail -1
```

Make sure the tag matches the last version that we are currently uploading for
review.

Upload source packages to wani.canonical.com for a review:
```
ssh wani.canonical.com mkdir -p for-review/xenial-linux-oracle
scp *4.15.0.1031.31* *4.15.0-1031.31* wani.canonical.com:~/for-review/xenial-linux-oracle
```

After source packages and git repositories have been reviewed and acknowledged
by another kernel team member, copy the signed packages locally to your host
and upload them using dput:
```
dput -u ppa:canonical-kernel-team/ppa linux-oracle_4.15.0-1010.12~16.04.1_source.changes
dput -u ppa:canonical-kernel-team/ppa linux-meta-oracle_4.15.0.1010.4_source.changes
dput -u ppa:canonical-kernel-team/ppa linux-signed-oracle_4.15.0-1010.12~16.04.1_source.changes
```

**Note** Make sure you have ```default_host_main = UNKNOWN"``` set in your
~/.dput.cf, to prevent uploading packages to ```ubuntu```.

### Special kernels

Pay attention to the following kernels, they require special actions to be
cranked:
- linux-euclid
- linux-fips
- linux-ibm-gt
- all the edge kernels (i.e., linux-hwe-edge)
- all the esm kernels, currently precise/linux and precise/linux-lts-trusty

#### -meta only packages

Some -edge kernels are -meta only cranks. This is because the regular and
and the -edge kernels for that variant (e.g. as of now xenial/linux-hwe and
xenial/linux-hwe-edge) might have the same version for a period of time
until we update the -edge kernel to be based on a newer series. During this
time we only update the -meta package of the -edge kernel to have as
dependency the regular kernel. You can see that a package is -meta only by
looking at the tracking bug, which will have the 'prepare-package' task set
to 'Invalid', or by running cranky checkout which will checkout the regular
branch on the main repo (e.g. hwe instead of hwe-edge).

For these cases the procedures are:

1. Checkout the -edge branch of the meta package and the regular branch of
   the main repos (e.g. hwe branch of xenial/linux and hwe-edge of
   xenial/linux-meta). 'cranky checkout' should already checkout these
   branches correctly.

2. Update the meta package by running "./update-version <main repo path>",
   pointing to the main repo path of the regular variant. Commit and tag
   as a regular -meta package.

3. Update the package version on the tracking bug of the -edge package.
   As of now this still needs to be done manually, by copying the same
   version from the tracking of the regular variant package.

4. Build the sources only for the -edge -meta package.

5. Continue with the remaining steps as documented above (sign, review,
   upload, etc) only for the -meta package.
