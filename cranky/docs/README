== On Chroots ==

Chroots should be used as most as possible. The reason to use a chroot is that:

1) Our rules Makefiles may depend on a specific version of kernel-wedge.

2) updateconfig, or rather, kconfig syncconfigs, on later Linux versions
(starting with 4.18), depend on compiler options, and those must match the
compiler that will be used to build the kernel.

3) Those dependencies can be installed on a chroot, and leave the root system
"clean".

Reasons not to use chroot:

1) Inconvenienced or insecure access to your GPG or SSH keys.
