== Early ==
 - Choose unique kernel name
  - Pick a sensible name which will not collide with other projects from
    the same customer/hardware etc.
 - Create source repositories
  - PUBLIC: create new repositories for the various components in
    lp:~canonical-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux-<kernel-name>/+git/<series>.
  - PRIVATE: create appropriate repositories in our private project.
 - Add new kernel to kernel-series
  - Add the new kernel to kernel-series marked supported: false so we
    reserve the name.
  - Ensure we have appropriate repo definitions so that reviewer can find
    the trees.
 - Identify package routing
  - PUBLIC: we will use default routing and the archive.
  - PRIVATE: figure out where this will be built and published.  We will
    require a build PPA, possibly a signing PPA, a proposed PPA, and an updates
    PPA.
  - Add this information to kernel-series.
 - Plumb project into CVE tracker
  - If needed plumb this kernel into the CVE tracker.
 - Review Initial Tree
  - review the current version of the tree with a view to maintainability

== Handover ==
 - Review Final Tree
  - review the current version of the tree with a view to maintainability
 - Confirm Team Access (private only)
  - PRIVATE: add ~canonical-kernel-uploaders to the project
  - PRIVATE: give ~canonical-kernel-uploaders write access to the git
    repositories (admin-lp-update-permissions should do this once it is
    in kernel-series)
  - PRIVATE: subscribe ~canonical-kernel-crankers to the build, proposed,
    and updates PPAs
  - PRIVATE: subscribe ~canonical-kernel-crankers to the git repositories
 - Confirm ubuntu-bot Access (private only)
  - PRIVATE: add ~ubuntu-kernel-bot to the project so it has permission
    to acccess the repositories and PPAs
  - PRIVATE: add a git insteadOf configuration for this on wani
   - wani.canonical.com:~kernel-ppa/shankbot/.gitconfig
 - Mark the kernel supported in kernel-series
  - Where the kernel is to follow the primary SRU cycle we will mark it
    supported: true in kernel-series.
