    - In kteam-tools/info/kernel-series.yaml:
       - New section for the new series.
       - Mark the new series as “supported : false”; “development: true”; “opening:”
       - CHECK: confirm that we have derived kernels specified correctly in the previous series.
 - Archive opening -- closed
    - NEEDS: archive published
    - OPENING: opening: archive-closed: true
 - Archive opening -- open
    - NEEDS: final name set and archive accepting uploads

 - Add repositories to wani mirroring
    - NEEDS: repos
    - Wait for mirroring to create repos
    - add symlinks to ubuntu directory to expose them for legacy user
 - Create new linux-snap git repository
    - NEEDS: launchpad admin for ubuntu-kernel
    - NOTE: Only needed on LTSs for their corresponding ucNN
    - NOTE: Likely is already created so we can test against development.
    - git fetch origin
    - git push lp:~ubuntu-kernel/+git/kernel-snaps-ucNN refs/remotes/origin/master:refs/heads/master
 - Request new snap tracks
    - NOTE: Only needed on LTSs for their corresponding ucNN
    - NOTE: Likely is already created so we can test against development.
    - Email snap-store-admins@lists.canonical.com requesting all the new tracks needed,

    - NEEDS: linux-snap git repository created
    - NEEDS: new series tracks created
    - Create recipies (Producing snaps documentation)
 - Prime builder-extras for the new series

    - Copy any valid packages in old series to new series
 - Add series to chroot creation
    - NEEDS: builder-extras primed
