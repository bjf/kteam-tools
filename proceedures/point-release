== Before nn.nn Release ==
 - Identify point release owner
    - Identify the formal owner for the cycle.
 - Identify formal release date
    - Find the formal release date for use in cycle selection.
    - Update the board title with this date.
 - Pick point release kernel cut over cycle and announce
    - Pick a likely last SRU cycle to hit the point release image, this
      should be two cycles before the point release.
    - announce to kernel-team@ mailing list etc
 - Identify kernels to be rolled with the point release
    - Copy "Roll linux-foo-edge to point release version" card for
      all kernels which will be rolled at the point release to this
      column.
    - Copy "Roll linux-foo to linux-foo-edge package" cards for the same
      list of kernels to the "At Cut Over" column.
 - Roll linux-foo-edge to point release version
  - Prepare and upload updates to the linux-foo-edge package moving it
    to the release kernel base version as soon as the primary series
    kernel reaches the final version.
 - Review linux-*-edge testing
  - Once kernels are rolled review ADT testing for those and create
    cards to fix any issues found.

== At Cut Over ==
 - Review linux-*-edge upgrade testing and approve
  - Review all of the ADT and upgrade testing and approve rolls
 - Roll linux-foo to linux-foo-edge package
  - Update the variants of the linux-foo-edge package to '-foo' so the
    meta and lrm packages will start producing the final variant and
    replace the older ones.
  - Note: we need to confirm testing and have stakeholder-signoff for
    these.

== Roles ==
 - Point Release Owner: <insert name>
