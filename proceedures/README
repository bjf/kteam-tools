The official checklists for the kernel team is in the relevant proceedure
files this directory.  Each proceedure file represents a separate
checklist.  Each section represents a list to create and populate.
Within each section each top level list item represents a separate card
in that checklist.

Create a new board for the checklist to populate.  The proceedure-cards
script will use the so-trello (snap install so-trello) command to create
the lists and cards from the proceedure file:

  ./proceedure-cards [--component <component>] <project> <proceedure.yaml>

  ./proceedure-cards --component SPOC KERN series-opening.yaml
