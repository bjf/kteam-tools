These scripts are used on kernel.canonical.com to produce builds of mainline
Linux kernels using Ubuntu configuration (as much as possible). This provides
testers a way to confirm if the bug is fixed upstream and helps in testing of
upstream kernels too.

For the most part these scripts assume that are on kernel.u.c, but you can
build on other machines with a couple of preparation steps.

1) mkdir -p $HOME/COD
2) cd $HOME/COD; git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
3) Add remotes for the series agasinst which you want to build:
	for i in dapper hardy jaunty karmic lucid maverick
	do	
		(cd $HOME/COD; git remote add $i git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-$i.git)
	done

Now you can build against an arbitrary SHA1 using any series as a base. For example,

	cd $HOME/COD/linux-2.6
	$HOME/kteam-tools/mainline-build/mainline-build-one v2.6.33-rc1 maverick

This will create a branch BUILD.020633rc1, pull the maverick debian bits, then build the kernel.


== Ad Hoc patches ==

The adhoc patches directory contains a series of automatically triggered patches.
Each patch contains a TRIGGER line in the commentary section.  This lists the
md5sum and filename of a file in the source tree.  When this file is found
with the same sum the patch is applied, otherwise it is not.  This allows
patches to be added for specific source combinations.
