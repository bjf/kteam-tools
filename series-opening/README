We recommend creating a new Trello board for the checklist and creating
cards for each of the steps listed in the checklist.  The proceedure-cards
script will use the so-trello (snap install so-trello) command to create
these from the document.

Create a new trello board called something sensible like "Artful Opening"
and add a "Backlog" list to it.  Then visit the above document and save
a textual copy of it; File/Download/Plain text (*.txt).  Then use the
command below to create the cards:

  ./proceedure-cards 'Artful Opening' 'Backlog' CHECKLIST.txt 'New Series Opening'
