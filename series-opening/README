= Series Opening/Point Release/Series Closing Checklist =

The official checklists for the kernel team is in the file CHECKLIST in
this directory.  Each top level section represents a separate checklist.
Within each section each top level list item represents a separate card
in that checklist.

We recommend creating a new Trello board for the checklist and creating
cards for each of the steps listed in the checklist.  The proceedure-cards
script will use the so-trello (snap install so-trello) command to create
these from the document.

Create a new trello board called something sensible like "Artful Opening"
and add a "Backlog" list to it.  Then use the command below to create
the cards:

  ./proceedure-cards 'Artful Opening' 'Backlog' 'New Series Opening'
